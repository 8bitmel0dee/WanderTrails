# WanderTrails


WanderTrails web app, a hiking journal app, keeps track of the user’s hiking adventures. The user is able to create a database of all the trails traveled. The user inputs the trail location, date traveled, length, and difficulty of each trail. The user is able to log-in and save their hiking information to their account and view their previously logged hiking trails – displayed in order of their choosing: date, rating, trail length, or difficulty and is provided an option to edit and delete their information.

Built with React, Bootstrap, and a json-server as a mock RESTful API.
